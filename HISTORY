Release 0.0.3:
-fixed undefined symbol error when not using NO_EPG patch
-declare Nagra-events that have day-of-the month in the period between today-7days and yesterday as "old events"; some providers keep sending old eepg data that otherways are presented as next months'
-stopped processing the second title-field that is sent with Nagra, since it is not clear when it is valid 
-make eepg-plugin actually obey the rules defined by the NO_EPG patch, if used
-fixed all compiler warnings

Release 0.0.2a:
-fixed problem in NagraGuide, where month of title could get random value

Release 0.0.2:
-decoded and added NagraGuide
-tested daylight savings functionality for SKY_UK
-added daylight savings fucntionality for MHW1 and NAGRA
-added possiblity to scan more eepg-streams on same transponder (like CanaalDigitaalNL, both MHW1 and Nagra)
-disabled scan after 1 hour idle time; this was unused functionality, since a) most updates are once/24 hour, and b) most of the time zapping is done within 1 hour
-added lookup for eventid, so existing events will be updated instead of added. This means less use for the DD_EPG patch, because double EPG entries will be minimized.
-fixed compile problem when using NO_EPG patch
-added hexdump routine for debugging
-improved use of TableId's, so now the plugin can decide whether to overwrite or to preserve the existing EPG data
-improved several routines, less memory use, less cpu use.

Release 0.0.1:
First release.
